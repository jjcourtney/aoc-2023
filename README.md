# Advent of code 2023

Advent of code can be found at [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo holds my solutions for the 2023 challenges in javaScript, they are mostly un-refactored, the code was written to work not look pretty or even be the most efficient (however there were some challenges when efficency was required due to stack / heap size).

The data I have `data.mjs` files I have used have been transformed into new data structures. The raw data for each of the challenges is avalible at the above link for the given challenge.
